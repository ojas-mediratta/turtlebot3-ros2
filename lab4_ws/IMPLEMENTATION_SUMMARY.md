# Lab 4 Implementation - Code Review & Changes

## Summary of Updates (Based on lab4.pdf Requirements)

All changes have been implemented and the workspace builds successfully.

---

## ✅ Changes Implemented

### 1. **get_object_range.py** - Enhanced Obstacle Detection

**Key Improvements:**
- ✅ **LIDAR Point Clustering**: Implements clustering algorithm to distinguish discrete obstacles from walls/furniture
- ✅ **Wall Rejection**: Filters out clusters wider than 1.0m (likely walls)
- ✅ **Minimum Cluster Size**: Requires ≥5 points to be a valid obstacle (reduces noise)
- ✅ **Proximity Warnings**: Logs warnings when obstacles are <20cm (collision risk) or <35cm (close)
- ✅ **Robust Filtering**: Per PDF requirement to handle "walls or stray chair/other robot"

**Parameters (Tunable in code):**
```python
front_half_angle_deg = 50.0        # Scan ±50° (100° total arc)
min_valid_range = 0.05             # Ignore <5cm (noise)
max_considered_range = 2.0         # Ignore >2m (far objects)
cluster_max_gap = 0.15             # Points >15cm apart = different clusters
min_cluster_size = 5               # Need ≥5 points for valid obstacle
max_cluster_width = 1.0            # Reject >1m wide (walls)
```

**Algorithm Flow:**
1. Collect valid LIDAR points in forward sector
2. Cluster consecutive points by distance gap
3. Filter clusters (size & width thresholds)
4. Compute centroids of valid clusters
5. Publish nearest cluster centroid as obstacle vector

### 2. **go_to_goal.py** - Precision Navigation

**Key Improvements:**
- ✅ **Approach Slowdown**: Robot slows down within 30cm of waypoint for better positioning
  - Maximizes exponential scoring: `25% × e^(-distance/25)`
  - Linear speed reduction: `v = max_v × (dist / 0.30)`
- ✅ **Enhanced Potential Field**: Better balance of attractive/repulsive forces
- ✅ **Sharp Turn Reduction**: Cuts speed 50% when heading error >45°
- ✅ **Strict Speed Limits**: Hard-clamped to |v|≤0.20 m/s, |w|≤1.50 rad/s

**Parameters (Tunable in code):**
```python
k_lin = 0.6                        # Attractive force gain
k_ang = 2.2                        # Heading correction gain
k_rep = 1.3                        # Repulsive force gain
rep_cutoff = 0.7                   # Repulsion active when obs <0.7m
approach_slowdown_radius = 0.30    # Start slowing when <30cm from goal
min_approach_speed = 0.05          # Minimum speed (maintain momentum)
```

**State Machine:**
- `DRIVE`: Navigate using potential field with approach slowdown
- `DWELL`: Hold position for 10 seconds
- `DONE`: All waypoints complete, stop motors

## 📋 Testing Checklist

### Pre-Launch Verification
```bash
cd ~/autobots/lab4_ws/
colcon build --symlink-install          # ✅ Build succeeds
source install/setup.bash
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=76                 # CRITICAL!
```

### Launch Sequence
```bash
# Terminal 1: Robot bringup
ros2 launch turtlebot3_bringup robot.launch.py

# Terminal 2: Navigation
ros2 launch autobots_navigate_to_goal nav_lab4.launch.py
```

### Monitor During Demo
```bash
# Check speed limits (CRITICAL)
ros2 topic echo /cmd_vel | grep -E "linear|angular"

# Monitor obstacle detection
ros2 topic echo /obstacle_vector

# Watch node status
ros2 topic hz /cmd_vel /obstacle_vector
```

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### Waypoint Navigation
- **Waypoint 0**: (1.5, 0.0) → tolerance 10cm → dwell 10s
- **Waypoint 1**: (1.5, 1.4) → tolerance 15cm → dwell 10s
- **Waypoint 2**: (0.0, 1.4) → tolerance 20cm → dwell 10s

### Approach Behavior (NEW)
Robot will:
1. Approach at max speed (0.20 m/s) when far from goal
2. Start slowing down when within 30cm of waypoint
3. Speed proportionally reduces: v = 0.20 × (distance / 0.30)
4. This ensures robot centers on waypoint coordinates (better exponential score)

### Obstacle Avoidance
- Purple obstacle detected via clustering algorithm
- Repulsive force activates when obstacle <0.7m
- Robot steers around obstacle using potential field
- Proximity warnings logged when <20cm

## 🔧 Parameter Tuning Guide

### If Robot Too Aggressive (hitting obstacles):
```python
# In go_to_goal.py:
k_rep = 1.5              # Increase repulsive force
rep_cutoff = 0.9         # Activate repulsion earlier

# In get_object_range.py:
front_half_angle_deg = 60.0  # Widen detection arc
```

### If Robot Too Slow/Cautious:
```python
# In go_to_goal.py:
k_lin = 0.8              # Increase attractive force
approach_slowdown_radius = 0.20  # Reduce slowdown zone
```

### If Robot Oscillates Near Goal:
```python
# In go_to_goal.py:
k_ang = 1.8              # Reduce angular gain
```

### If Robot Seeing False Obstacles:
```python
# In get_object_range.py:
min_cluster_size = 8     # Require more points
max_cluster_width = 0.8  # Stricter wall rejection
```

## 📊 Grading Alignment

### Distance from Waypoint (Exponential Scoring)
| Distance | Score | Our Strategy |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| 0cm | 100% | Approach slowdown centers robot |
| 5cm | 82% | Proportional speed reduction |
| 10cm | 67% | Better than binary "in/out" |
| 20cm | 45% | Tolerance limits |

**Our Implementation**: Approach slowdown (within 30cm) maximizes centering precision.

### Time Limit: 2:30
- No explicit timer (focus on optimal behavior)
- Efficient navigation via potential field
- Quick obstacle avoidance

### Collision Penalty: -5% each
- Proximity warnings at <20cm
- Robust clustering rejects walls
- Repulsive force prevents collisions

## 🚨 Critical Reminders

1. **ROS_DOMAIN_ID=76** must be set in EVERY terminal
2. **Speed limits are HARD CONSTRAINTS** - never exceed
3. **Purple obstacle orientation is random** - don't assume position
4. **Build with --symlink-install** for faster parameter tuning
5. **Waypoints must be in wayPoints.txt** in correct format

---

## 📝 Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Verify nodes running
ros2 node list

# Check topic rates
ros2 topic hz /scan /odom /cmd_vel

# Emergency stop
ros2 topic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist "{linear: {x: 0.0}, angular: {z: 0.0}}" --once

# Monitor real-time
ros2 topic echo /obstacle_vector  # See obstacle detection
ros2 topic echo /cmd_vel          # Verify speed limits
```

## ✅ Build Status

```
✅ Package: autobots_navigate_to_goal
✅ Nodes: get_object_range, go_to_goal
✅ Launch: nav_lab4.launch.py
✅ Build: SUCCESS (with deprecation warnings - normal)
```

## 📄 Files Modified

1. `get_object_range.py` - Added clustering, wall rejection, proximity warnings
2. `go_to_goal.py` - Added approach slowdown, enhanced potential field
3. Both files maintain exact topic/message contracts from lab requirements

**No changes needed to:**
- `setup.py` (entry points already correct)
- `package.xml` (dependencies already correct)
- `nav_lab4.launch.py` (already launches both nodes)
- `wayPoints.txt` (contains 3 waypoints as required)
